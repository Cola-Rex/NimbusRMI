# NimbusRMI

> **"Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they can't C#!"** ðŸ˜Ž

Welcome to **NimbusRMI**, the remote method invocation framework that's so fast and light, you'll wonder if it's running at all! (Spoiler: it is.)

## What is this thing?

Well, ever wanted to say "Hello" to someone on a different machine without, you know, actually walking over? Then NimbusRMI is your new best friend. It lets your code shout across the internet like an excited toddler, and miraculously, the other machine listens!

### Features (aka Why This Isn't Just Another Hello World)

- **Lightweight** â€“ It won't crash your computer unless you try *really* hard.
- **Distributed** â€“ Your code can call methods on a different machine. Just like calling your grandma, but less awkward.
- **Logging** â€“ Because if a bug happens in the server and nobody logs it, did it really happen?
- **Exception Handling** â€“ We've got it covered. Unlike my ability to handle my Monday mornings.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: Can I use this to send pizzas to my friends?**  
A: Sadly no. NimbusRMI is still working on its pizza delivery feature. Until then, try "Hello!"

**Q: Does this work with anything other than 'Hello'?**  
A: Yes, it works with anything your heart desires... as long as it's a string. No strings attached. ðŸ˜‰

**Q: Is this serious software?**  
A: As serious as a cat chasing a laser pointer.
